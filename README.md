## Overall Ideas
This is a living project at this time. Initially was a static HTML page for top scores. Has evolved to a Rails app.

In building out various aspects other concepts have come up.

Competition names will be stored in a table and selected from that for each area they are needed. This ensure consistency in what they are called.
Also allows event names to be updated when they change.

Skaters will be stored in a table and selected from a list when needed. This will allow a bio site to be generated that would include any accolades the skater has recieved.

# Top Score
Top score for all events using CPC/IJS. Currently that is STAR 5 to Senior, all AdultSkate, all Interpretive, all Triathalon, and all STAR Team events

Only the current highest score will be recoreded. Score will be recorded for each segment and total event as well as technical and component scores.

# +2 GOE
Any element that gets a +2 or +3 from at least one judge will be recorded. Skater, competition, element, grade of execution will be recorded.

# Gold & Diamond Tests

# STAR 1-4 Gold (Competition Assessment)

# STAR Assessment Pass With Honors
